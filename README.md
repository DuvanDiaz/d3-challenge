In this Journalism project, we have analyzed a dataset containing many of the things having an effect on how people live in the US.
We have looked at things like the average amount of families and individuals who reported to live in poverty,
and how that relates to other factors like people's obesity, and the average amount of tabacoo smokers in the country.
Another interesting thing we looked at, is the average amount of people who are able to afford healthcare protection for them,
and their loved ones. Using D3 techniques learnt in the class, we used that to help visualize, and give a more thorough understanding of the obtained conclusions from the analysis.
