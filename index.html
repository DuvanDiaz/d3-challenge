						<h2>Analysis Breakdown:</h2>
						<h3>Correlation Between Income and Healthcare </h3>
						<li>
                  Here we analyzed the relationship between average income per state compared with the average accesibility to health care for them and their families.
              Most of the population in each state earns just enough to cover bills and a lot of them have no access to good healthcare, simply because they cannot afford it.
              Some states like Kentucky, West Virginia, Alabama have reported an average range of 5-7% of the population have access to healthcare services. This can be caused
              for multiple reasons besides of course a lower average income in comparison with other states; lack of jobs that offer medical and other benefits, increase in low income, big sized families who simply have to take care of basics nd cannot afford
              healthcare coverage. Other states with a higher average income report a not much higher healthcare coverage. It seems interesting to go further in this study and take an extra step, but of course a deduction can be done and 
              it has to do with a lot of people who cannot afford healthcare but the state goverment provides some kind of access to things like Medicare for All. Still, most of America's population earn enough to take care of bills, and most of the times
              will lack coverage, or the coverage they can afford is not enough for the high, increasing prices of health services of this day and age.

						<h3>Correlation between Poverty and Obesity</h3>
						<li>
                  In this section we are looking at the analysis of the correlation of poverty and obesity rate per state. The US has a big obesity problem since most of the population are obese or have reported to been obese. Part of the population who
              have reported to be obese, are also living in poverty. A big reason of why this happens, is the easily accesible cheap unhealthy fast processed food, sold in fast food joints and of course, it is a more affordable option for the people who earn 
              below the average income. Amongst the states that are the most obese, based on the research analysis, are: Lousiana, Misissipi, Arkansas, West Virginia, two of which also report to have the lowest average income in the country. As an example, in the graph above, 
              we could observe that it has reported that a 36% of their population are obese, and 21% of the population live in what is considered poverty. A real problem in America is how healthy food seems to be only accesible to people who can afford it. It does not necessarily, 
              there are not personal habits and  behavior, for which people who are obese have to take responsability for as well. Meaning that it is not impossible to eat a healthy balanced diet when living in poverty, but it does seem "more money for your buck" for the people who have low income
              and rather uy bigger portions of fast food for low price.

						<h3>Comparison of the Amount of Smokers and their Age</h3>
						<li>
                  Based on the analysis, most of the people who provided their information to the census, are 30 years and older. The fact is that most people who report to be smokers, usually start at a early age, probably 14 and up. That being said, smoking is a habit that seems to have more effect in the 
              part of the population who live in poverty or earn just about a low income. It seems that low income people, seem to be 3 times more towards pick up smoking, than people who earn above the average income. Based on the anallyzed dataset, states like West Virginia, Kentucky, Tenesse, Lousisiana, 
              have reported to have almost 1/4 of the population who are active smokers, with an average age range of 30 to 37 years old. On the other hand, one state in particular reported to have the least amount of smokers in their population with an average of 9% of their population to be active smokers. 
              Most of the country report to have an average range of 17% - 20% being active smokers, with the same average age range of 30 to 35 years old. A deeper study needs to be done why most of low income communities report to have a big amount of smokers. And the states mentioned above who reported to have
              the most amount of smokers per state, are also states where the tabacco price are way cheaper in comparison with the rest of the country, therefore more affordable to the population. 

              In conclusion, a lot of this behavioral habits have to do with personal accountability and responsability, meaning people could make a change on their decisions in respect with their eating habits, and not picking up unhealthy ones like drinking and smoking. That being said, more education and resources need
              to be invested in low income communities, to guide their people towards a healthy lifestyle without that meaning another bill to take care of. There could also be something done about how making healthy food more attractive and affordable to people of low income communities. It is also important to remember
              that America is a free country and is up to everyone else to live their life as they wish, even if that means having unhealthy habits. But that should not stop us from considering implementing healthy habits to our lives, resulting in happier healthier lifestyles.
