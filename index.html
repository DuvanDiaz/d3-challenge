						<h2>Analysis Breakdown:</h2>
						<h3>Correlation Between Income and Healthcare </h3>
						<li>
              Here we analyzed the relationship between average income per state compared with the average accesibility to health care for them and their families.
              Most of the population in each state earns just enough to cover bills and a lot of them have no access to good healthcare, simply because they cannot afford it.
              Some states like Kentucky, West Virginia, Alabama have reported an average range of 5-7% of the population have access to healthcare services. This can be caused
              for multiple reasons besides of course a lower average income in comparison with other states; lack of jobs that offer medical and other benefits, increase in low income, big sized families who simply have to take care of basics nd cannot afford
              healthcare coverage. Other states with a higher average income report a not much higher healthcare coverage. It seems interesting to go further in this study and take an extra step, but of course a deduction can be done and 
              it has to do with a lot of people who cannot afford healthcare but the state goverment provides some kind of access to things like Medicare for All. Still, most of America's population earn enough to take care of bills, and most of the times
              will lack coverage, or the coverage they can afford is not enough for the high, increasing prices of health services of this day and age.

						<h3>Education Level of 65+ People vs. Oral Health</h3>
						<li>
							According to an old study, white people are easily get skin cancer than other races. We analyzed the
							relationship between the proportion of white people and skin cancer rate. The correlation is 0.48, 
							we won't say it's high but it's not too low to ignore, it worths a further study.
						</li><br/>
						<h3>Education Level of 65+ People vs. Oral Health</h3>
						<li>
							This analysis is regarding the income level and smoking status. we selectd the family which gets food
							stamp and the correlation is 0.43. It's not too high but it worths a turther study.
